# tornadofx-template
Kotlin + tornadofx application template using gradle for build.

Partially inspired by https://github.com/edvin/tornadofx-idea-plugin/ but templates in his repository are out of date in my opinion, so i tryed to create updated version

## Features
  * This template allows you to use an OpenJDK with openjfx to build single jar file wich would work same on windows and linux systems
  * Build uses kotlin version 1.3.72
  * Using gradle version 6.4
